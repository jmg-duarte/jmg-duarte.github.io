Hey, my name is Jos√© Duarte, I am currently studying Computer Science at FCT-NOVA.
<br>
My interests include Distributed Systems, Networks and their Security.

Along with some friends we formed the Cybersecurity Group in our college. 
We promote weekly meetings were we mainly work on CTF challenges, 
we are looking to expand our horizons and if you have ideas, send me a tweet.
